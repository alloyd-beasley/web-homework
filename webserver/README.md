# Server Portion

## Setup

1. Install MongoDB (Community Edition)

2. Run `yarn` in /webserver (this directory)
    - This will also clear and seed the database with fake transaction data.
    - The seed script and transaction csv are located in webserver/util.

3. Run `yarn start` in /webserver
    - The `yarn start` script has been modified to use nodemon.
